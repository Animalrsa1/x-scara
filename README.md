Objective
===
X-SCARA is a project that intends to level-up SCARA design for CNC and 3D printing machines, to the same ease of functionality other mechanical models have, from the classical Cartesian to CoreXY, H-Bot, Delta etc.

If you are interested to know more about the motivation behind this project [this](README_LONG.md).

Hardware
===
![hardware logo](images/hardware.png)

The *Hardware* section will contain everything you need to build **X-SCARA**, from the *B.O.M.* listing of all off-the-shelf components you need to buy to build one, to STL files and assembly instructions.

    X-SCARA has published the first mechanical version, ready to be printed and assembled !

More details [here](hardware/README.md).

Firmware
===

**Currently work in progress.** 

Any work on firmware will be submitted [here](firmware/README.md).

Calibration procedure
===

**Currently work in progress.**

One of the show-stoppers in the SCARA design, we aim to find an easy and reliable method to setup the SCARA before starting each 3D printing. 

CAD
===

X-SCARA parts and assembly were fully designed in **Autodesk Fusion 360**.
