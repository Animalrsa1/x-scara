Objective
===
**X-SCARA** is a project that intends to level-up SCARA design for CNC and 3D printing machines, to the same ease of functionality other mechanical models have, from the classical Cartesian to CoreXY, H-Bot and Delta. If you are interested to know more about the motivation behind this project [this](README_LONG.md).

Hardware
===

    Updates: 
    - X-SCARA hardware is now at revision 5!
    - Added test-part accessory to calibrate your printer before you start printing X-SCARA
    - Added heated bed support directly connected to the X-SCARA frame

The hardware section will contain everything you need to build **X-SCARA**, from the *B.O.M.* to STL files and detailed assembly instructions. 

Check the [hardware section here](hardware/README.md) and if you want to check for updates and/or new accessories take a look at the [changelog](hardware/CHANGELOG.md).

Firmware
===
    Updates:
    - X-SCARA firmware version is now 0.2 Alpha! 
    - Homing and bed leveling will be available in the next version.

For firmware build and configuration follow [these instructions](firmware/README.md), and if you are already using it check the [changelog](firmware/CHANGELOG.md) for any updates.

Calibration procedure
===
Read [here](CALIBRATION.md) more about you can calibrate **X-SCARA** and start printing.
